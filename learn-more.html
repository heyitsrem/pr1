            Learn more about Climate Change
        </h1>
        <p class="description">
            In this page, we will discuss what can cause, the effects,
            <br>
            and how you can take action toward climate change. Even from your home.
        </p>

    <div class="cocc">
            <h1>Causes of Climate Change</h1>
            <p>
                The heat of the sun is trapped as greenhouse gas emissions blanket the Earth. As a result, global warming and climate change occur. The Earth is currently warming at a rate unprecedented in recorded history.
            </p>
            <div class="cocc-image"></div>
            </div>
    <div class="cocc1">
        <h1>Generating power</h1>
        <p align="justify">
            Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas causes a large chunk of global emissions. Most electricity is still produced from fossil fuels; only about a quarter comes from wind, solar and other renewable sources.
        </p>
        <div class="image2"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="cocc a">
        <h1>Manufacturing goods</h1>
        <p>
            Manufacturing and industry produce emissions, mostly from burning fossil fuels to produce energy for making things like cement, iron, steel, electronics, plastics, clothes and other goods. Mining and other industrial processes also release gases.
        </p>
        <div class="image3"></div>
        </div>
    <div class="cocc1">
        <h1>Cutting down forests</h1>
        <p align="justify">
            Cutting down forests to create farms or pastures, or for other reasons, causes emissions, since trees, when they are cut, release the carbon they have been storing. Since forests absorb carbon dioxide, destroying them also limits nature’s ability to keep emissions out of the atmosphere.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="image4"></div>
    <div class="cocc c">
        <h1>Using transportation</h1>
        <p>
            Most cars, lorries, ships and planes run on fossil fuels. That makes transportation a major contributor of greenhouse gases, especially carbon-dioxide emissions. Road vehicles account for the largest part, but emissions from ships and planes continue to grow.
        </p>
        <div class="image5"></div>
        </div>
    <div class="cocc1">
        <h1>Producing food</h1>
        <p align="justify">
            Producing food requires energy to run farm equipment or fishing boats, usually with fossil fuels. Growing crops can also cause emissions, like when using fertilisers and manure. Cattle produce methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. And emissions also come from packaging and distributing food.
        </p>
    </div>
        <div class="image6"></div>
    <div class="cocc c">
        <h1>Powering buildings</h1>
        <p>
            Globally, residential and commercial buildings consume over half of all electricity. As they continue to draw on coal, oil and natural gas for heating and cooling, they emit significant quantities of greenhouse gas emissions.
        </p>
        <div class="image7"></div>
        </div>

    <div class="cocc1">
        <h1>Consuming too much</h1>
        <p align="justify">
            Your home and use of power, how you move around, what you eat and how much you throw away all contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. So does the consumption of goods such as clothing, electronics and plastics.
        </p>
    </div>
        <div class="image8"></div>

    <div class="cocc c">
        <h1>Effects of Climate Change</h1>
        <p>
            Warmer temperatures are altering weather patterns and upsetting nature's natural balance. Humans and all other kinds of life on Earth are at risk as a result of this.
        </p>
        <div class="image9"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="cocc1">
        <h1>Hotter temperatures</h1>
        <p align="justify">
            Nearly all land areas are seeing more hot days and heat waves; 2020 was one of the hottest years on record. Higher temperatures increase heat-related illnesses and can make it more difficult to work and move around. Wildfires start more easily and spread more rapidly when conditions are hotter.
        </p>
    </div>
        <div class="image10"></div>

    <div class="cocc c">
        <h1>More severe storms</h1>
        <p>
            Changes in temperature cause changes in rainfall. This results in more severe and frequent storms. They cause flooding and landslides, destroying homes and communities, and costing billions of pounds.
        </p>
        <div class="image11"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="cocc1">
        <h1>Increased drought</h1>
        <p align="justify">
            Water is becoming scarcer in more regions. Droughts can stir destructive sand and dust storms that can move billions of tons of sand across continents. Deserts are expanding, reducing land for growing food. Many people now face the threat of not having enough water regularly.
        </p>
    </div>
        <div class="image12"></div>

    <div class="cocc c">
        <h1>A warming, rising ocean</h1>
        <p>
            The ocean soaks up most of the heat from global warming. This melts ice sheets and raises sea levels, threatening coastal and island communities. The ocean also absorbs carbon dioxide, keeping it from the atmosphere. More carbon dioxide makes the ocean more acidic, which endangers marine life.
        </p>
        <div class="image13"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="cocc1">
        <h1>Loss of species</h1>
        <p align="justify">
            Climate change poses risks to the survival of species on land and in the ocean. These risks increase as temperatures climb. Forest fires, extreme weather and invasive pests and diseases are among many threats. Some species will be able to relocate and survive, but others will not.
        </p>
    </div>
        <div class="image14"></div>

    <div class="cocc c">
        <h1>Not enough food</h1>
        <p>
            Changes in climate and increases in extreme weather events are among the reasons behind a global rise in hunger and poor nutrition. Fisheries crops, and livestock may be destroyed or become less productive. Heat stress can diminish water and grasslands for grazing.
        </p>
        <div class="image15"></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="cocc1">
        <h1>More health risks</h1>
        <p align="justify">
            Changing weather patterns are expanding diseases such as malaria. Extreme weather events increase disease and death, and make it difficult for health care systems to keep up. Other risks to health include increased hunger and poor nutrition in places where people cannot grow or find sufficient food.
        </p>
    </div>
        <div class="image16"></div>

    <div class="cocc c">
        <h1>Poverty and displacement</h1>
        <p>
            Climate change increases the factors that put and keep people in poverty. Floods may sweep away urban slums, destroying homes and livelihoods. Heat can make it difficult to work in outdoor jobs. Weather-related disasters displace 23 million people a year, leaving many more vulnerable to poverty.
        </p>
        <div class="image17"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="cocc1">
        <h1>Taking Actions in Climate Change</h1>
        <p align="justify">
            Everyone can have a role in limiting climate change. We can make a difference in everything we do, from how we travel to how much electricity we use and what we eat. Begin by doing these ten steps to address the climate catastrophe.
        </p>
    </div>
        <div class="image18"></div>

        <div class="cocc c">
            <h1>Save energy at home</h1>
            <p>
                Much of our electricity and heat is powered by coal, oil and gas. Use less energy by lowering your heating and cooling, switching to LED light bulbs and energy-efficient electric appliances, washing your laundry with cold water or hanging things to dry instead of using a dryer.
            </p>
            <div class="image19"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="cocc1">
            <h1>Walk, cycle or take public transport</h1>
            <p align="justify">
                The world’s roads are clogged with vehicles, most of them burning diesel or petrol. Walking or riding a bike instead of driving will reduce greenhouse gas emissions – and help your health and fitness. For longer distances, consider taking a train or bus. And carpool whenever possible.
            </p>
        </div>
            <div class="image20"></div>

        <div class="cocc c">
            <h1>Eat more vegetables</h1>
            <p>
                Eating more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, and less meat and dairy, can significantly lower your environmental impact. Producing plant-based foods generally results in fewer greenhouse gas emissions and requires less energy, land and water.
            </p>
            <div class="image21"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="cocc1">
            <h1>Consider your travel</h1>
            <p align="justify">
                Aeroplanes burn large amounts of fossil fuels, producing significant greenhouse gas emissions. That makes taking fewer flights one of the fastest ways to reduce your environmental impact. When you can, meet virtually, take a train or skip that long-distance trip altogether.
            </p>
        </div>
            <div class="image22"></div>

        <div class="cocc c">
            <h1>Throw away less food</h1>
            <p>
                When you throw food away, you're also wasting the resources and energy that were used to grow, produce, package and transport it. And when food rots in a landfill, it produces methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. So use what you buy and compost any leftovers.
            </p>
            <div class="image23"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="cocc1">
            <h1>Reduce, reuse, repair & recycle</h1>
            <p align="justify">
                Electronics, clothes and other items we buy cause carbon emissions at each point in production, from the extraction of raw materials to manufacturing and transporting goods to market. To protect our climate, buy fewer things, shop second-hand, repair what you can and recycle.
            </p>
        </div>
            <div class="image24"></div>

        <div class="cocc c">
            <h1>Change your home's source of energy</h1>
            <p>
                Ask your utility company if your home energy comes from oil, coal or gas. If possible, see if you can switch to renewable sources such as wind or solar. Or install solar panels on your roof to generate energy for your home.
            </p>
            <div class="image25"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="cocc1">
            <h1>Switch to an electric vehicle</h1>
            <p align="justify">
                If you plan to buy a car, consider going electric, with more and cheaper models coming on the market. Even if they still run on electricity produced from fossil fuels, electric cars help reduce air pollution and cause significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions than petrol or diesel-powered vehicles.
